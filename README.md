Student can select name of their available teachers and ask query.Student can also check their inbox for reply to their queries. Teacher home page consists of list of queries asked to them. Teacher reply to respective queries asked to them.

Screens: 1.SplashScreen 2.Walkthrough 3.Student/Teacher Login 4.Student Query page 5.Teacher Reply page

Technology Stack: Android Studio, Firebase, MVC architecture

Future Implementation 1.This is a single state application so you need to maintain state once the user signs up. 2.Query and reply is based on emails which should work by names. 3.Query should get deleted from teachers home page when teacher replies to a particular query. 4.This is just a practice application and hence there are many vulnerabilities feel free to improve.
